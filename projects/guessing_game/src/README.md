The standard input for Rust is written using:
$ use std::io;
This helps in compilation to print an output of the user's input.

$ use rand::Rng;
This is a random number generator for the Rust language and it also helps provide the range of numbers for which the code is to generate.

$ use std::cmp::Ordering;
This is used to compare two inputs and choose if they are equal, or if one is greater than or less than the other.
